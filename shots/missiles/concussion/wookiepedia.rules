A concussion missile was a general short- to medium-range, anti-vehicle ordnance produced by many manufacturers from across the galaxy, one of the most notable being Dymek. They were vehicle mounted weapons, and could be found in most militaries' armory. The TIE Bomber was capable of loading up several magazines worth of concussion missiles into their launch bays to deploy onto a battlefield when needed.[4] A larger and more expensive version of the weapon was the assault concussion missile. A capital ship-grade ordnance, often employed by massive warships like the Victory I-class Star Destroyer, were used for planetary bombardment and anti-capital ship duties. There were also some variants that possessed homing capabilities.

('regular' missile)
A concussion missile is a short-range, winged or wingless anti-vehicle missile.
Each concussion missile features an armor-piercing tip that penetrates a target's hull before igniting the missile's compact energy pack, 
causing more devastating results than single-shot turbolaser cannons.
The impact triggers the missile's warhead, which contains a small energy pack that triggers a concussion blast that damages the surrounding area 
and disrupts instruments and equipment.
