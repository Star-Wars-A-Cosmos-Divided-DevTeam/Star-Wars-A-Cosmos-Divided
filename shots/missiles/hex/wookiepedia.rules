Hex missiles were powerful weapons of mass destruction capable of inflicting heavy amount of casualties to a targeted planet or city. They had a specially designed warhead that contained a payload of the chemical agent trihexalon. Trihexalon, also called dragon's breath, was a deadly biological weapon that was fatal to most humanoids. These weapons were first used in an attack on the capital city of Maramere, just before the outbreak of the Clone Wars.
