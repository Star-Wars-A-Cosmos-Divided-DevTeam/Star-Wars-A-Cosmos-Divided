Carbonite missiles were devastating weapons often used by the Zann Consortium during the Galactic Civil War. 
The missile's warhead contained supercooled carbonite that, when detonated, could damage and slow enemy ground forces, leaving them open to attack. 
In some cases, they could completely destroy them. 
The Missile Attack Launcher, produced by Merr-Sonn Munitions, Inc., had the ability to fire Carbonite Missiles along with regular explosive missiles, 
though it took time to rotate between the various types of warheads.
