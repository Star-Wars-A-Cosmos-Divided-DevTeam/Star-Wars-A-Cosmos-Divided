/**
If you really want to be 
The best of the best
You have to treat everyday
Like it is a whole new project
Dicipline is critical
You have to be able to show up
But you also have to enjoy the sh*t out of it

That simple
Put in the work and you get the results
But you have to embrace the long hours
Slepless nights and urges to quit
The same people who tell you it's too complicated
Didn't even try
So what are you waiting for? 

What do you do
When a thousand other people
Want excatly what you want
What if you're not the only one
That want's what you want
You have to outwork them

You gotta want it
As bad as you want to breathe
And if you want it that bad
If you are willing to give it that much
Then dreams do come true

Monday get better
Tuesday get better
Wednesday get better
Do that over a period of time
And then you get to where you wanna go

Consistency
Consistency
Consistency man
That's the name of the game bro
