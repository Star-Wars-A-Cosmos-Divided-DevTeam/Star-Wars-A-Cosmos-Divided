Introduction: SW:ACD 0.3.7+

Author : Lafiel

Description:
This is a work in progress. Ultimately it will include options for:
different floor
different floor projector lights
different deck lights
maybe different roofs; 
roofs eventually might get or share a custom layer with a community mod. So current layer is just temporary to avoid creating a mess now.
roofs can be colored via crew job

This implementation is meant to help with curving hangars on large ships.
