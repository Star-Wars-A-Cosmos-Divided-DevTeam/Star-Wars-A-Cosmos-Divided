Introduction: SW:ACD 0.3.7

Author : Lafiel

Description:
This part is meant to reduce lag for large builds.
The idea is to have a large part that when damaged and gets destroyed gets replaced by smaller 1x1 parts.
The solution implemented here is the "low-persistence" methode:
Where the large part has 1% of the total health it normally would represent. 
This was choosen to prevent simple destrution by stray PD shots or low damage shots which usually tend to be employed on mass, hence, extend the lag reduction goal.
When the part is destroyed the replacing 1x1 parts appear at 98% of their nominal heatlh. This is done for balance reasons.
The gap of 1% is intentional to compensate for loss damage values from powerful shots exceeding the part's 1% health.
This means on average there's a 0.5% discrepancy in damage loss or health loss. Higher excess damage loss cannot be accounted with current mechanics. 
Needless to say the loss fraction increases proportional to part size even with constant percentage.
It is currently not possible or viable to achieve better precision for balance.
