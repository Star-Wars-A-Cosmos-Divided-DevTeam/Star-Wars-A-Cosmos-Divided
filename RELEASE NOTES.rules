Ships Mod & Kroom's Normal Armor Expanded

    Parts which were previously borrowed from Kroom's Normal Armor Expanded (such as non-vanilla structure and non-vanilla non-star wars armour pieces) have now been removed
    Star Wars pre-built ships have been moved to a separate mod, that requires Kroom's Normal Armor Expanded to work properly
    You can download Kroom's Normal Armor Expanded here - https://forum.cosmoteer.net/d/8537-normal-armor-expanded-0-15-12a
    And SW ships here - https://forum.cosmoteer.net/d/12911-star-wars-a-cosmos-divided-ships-pack-cosmoteer-0-15-13

Other

    Removed Bounty Hunter support. As Star Wars ships have been moved to a separate mod, BH with SW:ACD was slightly broken and the gamemode is being removed in full release, we have removed bounty hunter support. You can use Star Wars ships/parts in bounty hunter mode (which may not work perfectly), but enemy ships will not be star wars ships.
