Sprite Def by SkipperWraith & Cody (VSCode Extension)

/**
 * Sprite definition guide for creating custom sprites.
 * 
 * Covers guidelines for:
 * - Editor icon sprite
 * - Blueprint sprites 
 * - Armor sprites
 * - External wall normal sprites
 * - Roof & Roof Normal sprites
 * 
 * For each sprite type, provides code snippet examples and explanation of:
 * - Core sprite size and color
 * - Border walls and roof color 
 * - External wall sprites
 *
 * Aims to standardize custom sprite creation across parts.

Icon:
	-Code-Snippet:
```rules
	EditorIcon
	{
		Texture
		{
			File = "icon.png"
			SampleMode = Linear
		}
		Size = [32, 32]
	}
```Sprite-Rules
	-Core Sprite: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
	-External_Grey_Wall: need to make selfmade border walls in similar thiccness (7px) to other walls using icon grey aka RGB(127, 127, 127) & dark icon grey RGB(139, 139, 139) or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts


Blueprints:
	-Code-Snippet:
```rules
		Blueprints
		{
			Type = BlueprintSprite
			File = "blueprints.png"
			Size = [1, 1]
		}
```Sprite-Rules
	-Core Sprite: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
	-Roof_Colour_Border: Included in all External_Blueprint_Walls.
	-External_Blueprint_Walls: use vanilla Style ext_blueprints_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts


Armor:
	-Code-Snippet:
```rules
			Floor
			{
				Layer = "floors"
				DamageLevels
				[
					{
						File = "armor.png"//should be floor.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_33.png"//should be floor_33.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_66.png"//should be floor_66.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
				]
			}
```Sprite-Rules
	-Core_Sprite: The Series specific sprite according to in partname declared (under-)size aka 1 Quarter = 16px * 64px etc.
	-Roof_Colour_Border: BETWEEN Core Sprite & External Roof Walls using Vanilla Roof Green aka RGB(0, 230, 0); 2px thicc  for straight parts, 1px in the nearest corner to core sprite for 90Â° edges. INCLUDED in my sprites in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts or roofxx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls
	-External_Roof_Walls: use vanilla Style external_xx_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts which INCLUDE Roof Colour Border 


External_Wall_Normals: <- NEW
	-Code-Snippet:
```lua
			Walls
			{
				Layer = "external_walls"
				DamageLevels
				[
					{
						File = "armor.png"							  //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals.png"	   //<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_33.png"						   //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals_33.png"	//<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_66.png"						   //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals_66.png"	//<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
				]
			}
```Sprite-Rules
	-Core Sprite: a grey box/whatever at same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
	-Roof_Colour_Border: Different & Included in all External_Wall_Normals.
	-External_Normals: use vanilla Style external_normals_xx_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts
//YES THE GREY-Borders NEED TO ADD UP NOT OVERLAP NOT OVERWRITE


Roof & Roof_Normals:
-Code-Snippet:
```lua
			Roof
			{
				Layer = "roofs"
				DamageLevels
				[
					{
						File = "roof.png"				   
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "roof_33.png"
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals_33.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "roof_66.png"
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals_66.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
				]
			}
```Sprite-Rules
	-Core Sprite only: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite [greened (Vanilla Roof Green aka RGB(0, 230, 0)) for roof & Normalized per Hand or thru SkipperWraith and his GIMP Plugin for normals] + whatever pattern the series uses.
	-no walls //showing thru from &Armor
	-no borders //showing thru from &Armor
	-Roof_Variants? sure be creative just tell me and i will widen the toggle/ provide the needed controller files...
