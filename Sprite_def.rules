Sprite Def by SkipperWraith & Cody (VSCode Extension)

/**
 * Sprite definition guide for creating custom sprites.
 * 
 * Covers guidelines for:
 * - Editor icon sprite
 * - Blueprint sprites 
 * - Armor sprites
 * - External wall normal sprites
 * - Roof & Roof Normal sprites
 * 
 * For each sprite type, provides code snippet examples and explanation of:
 * - Core sprite size and color
 * - Border walls and roof color 
 * - External wall sprites
 *
 * Aims to standardize custom sprite creation across parts.

Icon:
    -Code-Snippet:
```rules
    EditorIcon
    {
        Texture
        {
            File = "icon.png"
            SampleMode = Linear
        }
        Size = [32, 32]
    }
```Sprite-Rules
    -Core Sprite: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
    -External_Grey_Wall: need to make selfmade border walls in similar thiccness (7px) to other walls using icon grey aka RGB(127, 127, 127) & dark icon grey RGB(139, 139, 139) or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts


Blueprints:
    -Code-Snippet:
```rules
        Blueprints
        {
            Type = BlueprintSprite
            File = "blueprints.png"
            Size = [1, 1]
        }
```Sprite-Rules
    -Core Sprite: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
    -Roof_Colour_Border: Included in all External_Blueprint_Walls.
    -External_Blueprint_Walls: use vanilla Style ext_blueprints_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts


Armor:
    -Code-Snippet:
```rules
            Floor
            {
                Layer = "floors"
                DamageLevels
                [
                    {
                        File = "armor.png"//should be floor.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
                        Size = [1, 1]
                        UVRotation = 0
                    }
                    {
                        File = "armor_33.png"//should be floor_33.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
                        Size = [1, 1]
                        UVRotation = 0
                    }
                    {
                        File = "armor_66.png"//should be floor_66.png but lets save 3 equal sprites
                        Size = [1, 1]
                        UVRotation = 0
                    }
                ]
            }
```Sprite-Rules
    -Core_Sprite: The Series specific sprite according to in partname declared (under-)size aka 1 Quarter = 16px * 64px etc.
    -Roof_Colour_Border: BETWEEN Core Sprite & External Roof Walls using Vanilla Roof Green aka RGB(0, 230, 0); 2px thicc  for straight parts, 1px in the nearest corner to core sprite for 90° edges. INCLUDED in my sprites in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts or roofxx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls
    -External_Roof_Walls: use vanilla Style external_xx_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts which INCLUDE Roof Colour Border 


External_Wall_Normals: <- NEW
    -Code-Snippet:
```lua
			Walls
			{
				Layer = "external_walls"
				DamageLevels
				[
					{
						File = "armor.png"                              //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals.png"       //<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_33.png"                           //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals_33.png"    //<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "armor_66.png"                           //<- Same as Armor
						NormalsFile = "external_wall_normals_66.png"    //<- NEW Sprite used to give IN Part External Walls Normals
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
				]
			}
```Sprite-Rules
    -Core Sprite: a grey box/whatever at same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite
    -Roof_Colour_Border: Different & Included in all External_Wall_Normals.
    -External_Normals: use vanilla Style external_normals_xx_xx.png sprites found in ./Data/ships/terran/walls or my premade ones in Armor/Doonium/wall_parts
//YES THE GREY-Borders NEED TO ADD UP NOT OVERLAP NOT OVERWRITE


Roof & Roof_Normals:
-Code-Snippet:
```lua
            Roof
			{
				Layer = "roofs"
				DamageLevels
				[
					{
						File = "roof.png"                   
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "roof_33.png"
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals_33.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
					{
						File = "roof_66.png"
						NormalsFile = "roof_normals_66.png"
						Size = [1, 1]
						UVRotation = 0
					}
				]
			}
```Sprite-Rules
    -Core Sprite only: cut/made to same size as &Armor/Core_Sprite [greened (Vanilla Roof Green aka RGB(0, 230, 0)) for roof & Normalized per Hand or thru SkipperWraith and his GIMP Plugin for normals] + whatever pattern the series uses.
    -no walls //showing thru from &Armor
    -no borders //showing thru from &Armor
    -Roof_Variants? sure be creative just tell me and i will widen the toggle/ provide the needed controller files...
