TO DO: 
BUG: 7x10 Thruster effect shows through the Covered Nozzle when it should be hidden.
BUG: game switches you to blueprint mode when in construction mode.  I think this may be due to one of the parts not being operational and causing some illegality (maybe power cockpit)?
BUG: Shader causing crashes on certain systems - should this be removed entirely from mod (maybe create separate mod for shader options). See thread - https://discord.com/channels/314103695568666625/314115823910518795/1190081580950114355~~

NEW: Artillery/Siege Lasers 
NEW: Ball Laser Turrets
NEW: Deathstar Laser (with 2 sec long shots?)
NEW: (would like to implement a small ion blaster turret like disrupter shot)
CHANGE: Would like to research ability to make shots lose effectiveness over distance. E.g., xwing/small shots should be devastating if close but do 0 damage from afar.
