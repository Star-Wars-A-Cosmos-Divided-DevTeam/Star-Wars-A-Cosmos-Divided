TO DO: 
BUG: game switches you to blueprint mode when in construction mode.  I think this may be due to one of the parts not being operational and causing some illegality (maybe power cockpit)?
BUG: Shader causing crashes on certain systems - should this be removed entirely from mod (maybe create separate mod for shader options). See thread - https://discord.com/channels/314103695568666625/314115823910518795/1190081580950114355~~
BUG: Large Nodes not responsive during Hyperjump.  Crew doesn't take action leaving the jump at X% unfinished
ER: Need to add strings for Ion Accelerator and better explanation of Thruster Speed buffs.
ER: User Request Compatibility with optimal storage? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2999987697
NEW: Artillery/Siege Lasers 
NEW: Ball Laser Turrets
NEW: Deathstar Laser (with 2 sec long shots?)
NEW: (would like to implement a small ion blaster turret like disrupter shot)
CHANGE: Would like to research ability to make shots lose effectiveness over distance. E.g., xwing/small shots should be devastating if close but do 0 damage from afar.
