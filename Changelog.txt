TO DO: 
BUG: game switches you to blueprint mode when in construction mode.  I think this may be due to one of the parts not being operational and causing some illegality (maybe power cockpit)?
BUG: ~~Shader causing crashes on certain systems - should this be removed entirely from mod (maybe create separate mod for shader options). See thread - https://discord.com/channels/314103695568666625/314115823910518795/1190081580950114355~~
BUG: Large Nodes not responsive during Hyperjump.  Crew doesn't take action leaving the jump at X% unfinished
ER: Reverse thrusters tooooo faaaast (WIP)
ER: Need to add strings for Ion Accelerator and better explanation of Thruster Speed buffs.
