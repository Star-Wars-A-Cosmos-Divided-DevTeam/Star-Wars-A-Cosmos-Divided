# Star-Wars-A-Cosmos-Divided
If you make a change which is a bug fix, commit it to master branch and then pull request it into pre-release. That both branches get that commit and we can easily put out a new minor version with those bug fixes if needs be (eg for latest Cosmoteer version compatibility).
If you make a non bug fix change commit it to pre-release.
Pull request on anything you're not sure about or want others' opinions/help with.
